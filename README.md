# My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)
***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide
any working guide to an actual project.  
### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko)
or [PyTorch](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko), and other open source softwares.\\\For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependecies (Level 3 Heading)
- python 1 
- opencv-python 2
- tensorflow 3 
- openmmlab 4
- package manager 5

### Installation
In a bash terminal, run the following commands (*Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer*):
`$ sudo apt update\ $ conda create -n cv_detectio  $ python --version  $ python example.py`
